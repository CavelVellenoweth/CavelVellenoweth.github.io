    <p>
      Hi, I am Cavel Vellenoweth, a recent Master's graduate with commendation from the Nottingham Trent University. I was also awarded for the best project in Computer Science for that year!

      I have a lot of development experience with C# Asp.net, as can be see with some of the projects here, like NAME-LINK (one phrase description) and NAME-LINK (one phrase description).

      However, I also have knowledge and experience with other languages and technologies. On the pages for the relevant project, I go into further detail on how I've used them, but the languages and technologies I'm most familiar with are: 
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>C#</li>
      <li>C++</li>
      <li>Asp.Net (Core and Framework)</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>Javascript (Jquery and React)</li>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>Git</li>
      <li>SQL</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      I hope that this portfolio gives you a better understanding of who I am and the experience that I have. 
      If you want to contact me and give me feedback for this portfolio, or ask any questions, I'd love to hear from you at my email address below!
    </p>

    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>This website was developed for GitHub pages using HTML, CSS and React!

    This was my first time developing with React and was a novel learning project for the technology that taught me a lot about the usage and flow of the library when using it along with HTML. 

    The content on this page is a mixture of React components and standard HTML components, this section and the about me section are both HTML components, 
    however the header, footer and Projects list are all React components allowing them to be included on any of the pages on this website!
    
    I look forward to using React more in the future both to create dedicated React applications as well as using it in other HMTL related websites as an alternate to JQuery or other Javascript libraries.
